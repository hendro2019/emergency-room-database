# emergency-room-database

Emergency room database: For this class project my team and I designed and implemented a database for a hypothetical emergence room. We started with a list of requirements, from which we developed and ER diagram. From there me mapped that diagram into a schema, and finally wrote the SQL scrips to make a functional database.
